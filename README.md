# React Tic-Tac-Toe Assignment 2 - Quang bui

For this assignment, I implemented core components, including a Square component to render each square, and a Board component to manage the game state and determine the winner. I also added a calculateWinner function to check for winning conditions and customized the CSS to display a classic 3x3 grid layout, making the interface visually resemble a Tic-Tac-Toe board.

## Components
